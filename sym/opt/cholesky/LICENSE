This module implements a cholesky sparse matrix factorization algorithm adapted from
LDL/Suitesparse and its corresponding implementation in the SparseCholesky
module of the Eigen library.

    Eigen is primarily MPL2 licensed. See COPYING.MPL2 and these links:
    http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
    http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html

    Some files contain third-party code under BSD or LGPL licenses, whence the other
    COPYING.* files here.

    All the LGPL code is either LGPL 2.1-only, or LGPL 2.1-or-later.
    For this reason, the COPYING.LGPL file contains the LGPL 2.1 text.

    If you want to guarantee that the Eigen code that you are #including is licensed
    under the MPL2 and possibly more permissive licenses (like BSD), #define this
    preprocessor symbol:
    EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY
    For example, with most compilers, you could add this to your project CXXFLAGS:
    -DEIGEN_MPL2_ONLY
    This will cause a compilation error to be generated if you #include any code that is
    LGPL licensed.
